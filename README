Simple upload server
===============================================================================================

This is a simple upload server created in python3. It has been tested with python 3.4.3 on
Linux (Slackware 14.1) and FreeBSD 10.2. It will probably work with other versions of python
and on other distros.

It requires flask (which requires Werkzeug, Jinja2, and itsdangerous). 
Running 'pip3 install flask' will install flask and these dependencies.
In FreeBSD (and possibly other distros), you may also need to install py-sqlite3.
Do this with 'sudo make PYTHON_VERSION=3.4 install clean' in /usr/ports/databases/py-sqlite3
Replace PYTHON_VERSION as appropriate.

Before running the server, a config must be created and the database must be initialised.
It is recommended but optional that you use the interactive tool included to create the former,
by running './setup.py'. This will also initialise the database and create the folder to store
user uploads at the same time. The config is in a json format and is editable by hand so if you
wish to create the config by hand you can initialise the database by running './setup.py -i'.
Run setup.py with the -h flag to see more options.

Run the server with 'python3 server.py'. Please ensure that the user you are running the server
under has appropriate permissions to bind applications to the port you are using.
